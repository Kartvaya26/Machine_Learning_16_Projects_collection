🧠 Project 14: Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning in Python
📌 Overview:
Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. Early diagnosis can drastically improve the patient’s quality of life. This project builds a machine learning model to detect Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements 🧬🗣️

📂 Dataset:
Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle Variant]
Rows: 195
Columns: 24 (including name, MDVP features, and status)
Target Variable: status → 1 (Parkinson’s), 0 (Healthy)

🎯 Objective:
To develop an accurate predictive model that can classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on voice features such as frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic ratios 🎤📊

🛠️ Process:
1. Data Cleaning
• Dropped non-informative name column
• Checked for null/missing values

2. Feature Engineering
• Normalized input features
• Separated independent and dependent variables

3. Model Building
• Split data into train/test
• Applied several classifiers – Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
• Selected the best model based on accuracy and precision

4. Evaluation
• Accuracy: ≈ 91%
• Confusion Matrix & Classification Report used for deeper insight

🔍 Key Features Used:
• MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Jitter(%), MDVP:RAP
• MDVP:Shimmer, NHR, HNR
• Spread1, Spread2, D2 (nonlinear measures)

🧰 Tools Used:
• Python
• Pandas, NumPy – Data Handling
• Scikit-learn – ML Algorithms & Evaluation
• Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization 📉

✅ Results:
• High accuracy detection of Parkinson’s disease
• SVM classifier gave the best results
• Suitable for integration into basic diagnostic systems for early detection systems 🧪🩺

🔚 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare diagnosis. With just voice input and trained models, we can provide early indications of Parkinson’s, saving time and potentially lives ❤️📈

📂 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle Titanic Competition
Rows: ~891 (train), ~418 (test)
Target Variable: Survived → 1 (Survived), 0 (Did not survive)

🎯 Objective:
To build a model that can accurately predict survival using historical passenger data. This is a classic classification problem and a popular ML starter project.

🛠️ Process:
1. Data Preprocessing
• Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, Embarked
• Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, etc.) to numeric
• Engineered new features like FamilySize, IsAlone

2. Model Building
• Used multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
• Split dataset into training and validation
• Tuned hyperparameters for best performance

3. Evaluation
• Accuracy Score: ~85%
• Checked precision, recall, F1-score
• Cross-validation to reduce overfitting

🔍 Key Features Used:
• Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare
• SibSp, Parch, Embarked
• Title (extracted from names), IsAlone, FamilySize

🧰 Tools Used:
• Python
• Pandas, NumPy – Data Analysis
• Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
• Scikit-learn – ML Modeling & Evaluation 📊

✅ Results:
• Achieved solid accuracy with Random Forest
• Feature engineering played a key role
• Ready for submission to Kaggle for ranking! 🏆

🔚 Conclusion:
This project teaches end-to-end ML pipeline including preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. It’s a must-do for beginners and a great way to learn data science basics with a historical twist 🚢📘
